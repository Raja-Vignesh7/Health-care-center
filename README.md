# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Web Application

Welcome to the Cardiac Disease probability Prediction web application! This project utilizes a RandomForest model to predict the probabiliy for a person having cardiac disease based on various features. The web application provides an interactive interface for users to input various  features and receive a float value and a bar graph.

## Description
This project explores the prediction of cardiac disease probability using a dataset of health metrics. It is designed for data science enthusiasts, machine learning practitioners, and healthcare analysts. The project demonstrates the use of a RandomForest model to predict the likelihood of cardiac disease based on inputs such as age, height, weight, cholesterol level, glucose level, and blood pressure. The web application allows users to input these metrics and obtain a probability estimate, showcasing a practical application of classification analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project provides a comprehensive collection of health metrics, including:

- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Cholesterol level
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic)

This dataset is sourced from Kaggle, making it ideal for learning and experimentation in the field of health data analysis.
